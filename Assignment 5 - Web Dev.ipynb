    "Synchronous: Synchronous execution means that each operation is performed one after the other in a sequential manner. When a synchronous operation is initiated, the program waits for it to complete before moving on to the next operation. This means that the execution of code blocks in JavaScript is blocking, and the program cannot continue until the current operation is finished.\n",

    "Asynchronous: Asynchronous execution, on the other hand, allows multiple operations to be initiated without waiting for each operation to complete before moving on to the next one.
