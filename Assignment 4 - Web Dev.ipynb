    "Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior that allows variables and function declarations to be moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that regardless of where declarations appear in the code, they are effectively \"hoisted\" to the top of their scope.\n",

    "\n",
    "Arrow Functions: A concise syntax for defining anonymous functions, using the => arrow notation. Arrow functions provide lexical scoping of this and have implicit returns for one-line expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Block-Scoped Variables: The let and const keywords were introduced to declare block-scoped variables, replacing the function-scoped variables of var. Block-scoped variables are more predictable and less prone to bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes: The class syntax provides a more traditional object-oriented programming (OOP) approach to creating objects and defining classes in JavaScript, simplifying the process of creating constructor functions and prototypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules: ES6 introduced a standardized module system using the import and export keywords. This allows JavaScript code to be split into separate modules, each with its own scope and dependencies, promoting modularity and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Template Literals: Template literals are an enhanced string syntax that allows for multiline strings, string interpolation, and expressions inside strings using the ${} syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Destructuring Assignment: Destructuring assignment enables extracting values from arrays or objects and assigning them to variables in a more concise and readable way. It simplifies variable assignment and parameter handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced Object Literals: Object literals gained new syntax and capabilities, such as shorthand property and method definitions, computed property names, and the ability to define setters and getters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Default Parameters: Function parameters can now have default values assigned, allowing for more flexibility and eliminating the need for manual checks and fallbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spread and Rest Operators: The spread operator (...) allows the expansion of an array or an object into individual elements, while the rest parameter syntax allows the gathering of multiple function arguments into an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promises: Promises were introduced as a native way to handle asynchronous operations, providing better control flow and error handling compared to traditional callback-based approaches.\n"
