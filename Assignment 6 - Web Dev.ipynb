    "\n",
    "OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm, which is a programming approach based on the concept of objects. It is a way to structure and design software applications by representing real-world entities as objects that have properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). OOPS provides a set of principles and concepts that enable modular, scalable, and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key concepts of OOPS:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and Objects: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It encapsulates data (attributes) and functionality (methods) related to a specific entity. Objects are instances of classes, representing individual entities that can interact with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling related data and methods together within a class, hiding the internal implementation details from external access. It allows for data abstraction and provides controlled access to object properties, ensuring data integrity and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/superclass). It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, enabling the creation of specialized classes based on existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. Polymorphism enables flexibility, extensibility, and the ability to write generic code that can work with objects of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by identifying essential features and ignoring irrelevant details. It allows the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define common behavior and provide a blueprint for concrete implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Association, Aggregation, and Composition: These are different types of relationships between objects. Association represents a loosely coupled relationship between objects, where one object can refer to another. Aggregation represents a \"has-a\" relationship, where an object contains other objects but can exist independently.\n",

    "ðŸ’¡ Question-5: Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?\n",
    "\n",
    " Solution-5:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves simplifying complex systems by identifying and focusing on essential features while ignoring unnecessary details. It provides a higher-level representation of objects and their behavior, allowing programmers to work with simplified models of complex entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key aspects and benefits of abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hiding Implementation Details: Abstraction allows to hide internal implementation details of an object and expose only the relevant information and functionality to the outside world. By concealing complex internal mechanisms, we can create simpler and more intuitive interfaces for interacting with objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating Abstract Classes and Interfaces: Abstraction enables the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define a common set of properties and methods for a group of related objects. These abstract entities serve as blueprints or contracts for concrete implementations, allowing us to define a common behavior and establish a level of consistency across different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promoting Code Reusability: Abstraction supports the reuse of code by defining abstract classes and interfaces that can be extended or implemented by multiple concrete classes. This allows to create generic code that operates on abstract entities, providing flexibility to handle different types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifying Complexity: Abstraction allows to focus on the essential aspects of an object or system while hiding unnecessary details. By abstracting away low-level implementation complexities, we can work at a higher level of understanding and tackle larger-scale problems without getting bogged down in intricate implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhancing Maintainability: Abstraction improves code maintainability by providing a clear separation between the interface and the implementation. Changes made to the internal implementation details of an object or class do not affect the code that depends on its abstract interface."

    "\n",
    "Here are some key aspects and benefits of polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Polymorphism enables the reuse of code by defining common interfaces, abstract classes, or base classes that can be inherited or implemented by multiple derived classes. Code written to interact with the common interface can be used with any object that adheres to that interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility and Extensibility: Polymorphism allows for easy extensibility of code. New classes can be added to the system without modifying the existing code that relies on the common interface. This promotes the Open-Closed Principle, one of the SOLID principles, which states that software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Overriding: Polymorphism enables method overriding, which allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method defined in its superclass. When a method is called on an object, the actual implementation is determined dynamically at runtime based on the object's type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run-Time Polymorphism: Polymorphism in OOP is typically achieved through dynamic or run-time polymorphism. This means that the specific method implementation to be executed is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object.\n",
